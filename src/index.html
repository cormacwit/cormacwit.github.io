                <h3>Description</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Gjallarhorn is an automated alert system and workload management tool designed primarily for use in multinational offices or offices that operate on a hybrid work-from-home schedule, focusing mainly on 24-hour operation centers such as those used by security teams or IT support centers.</p><br>

                <p>It accomplishes this through a client-side script that monitors endpoint activity (via mouse movement and keyboard activity) and sends information about user activity to the server. This data is then displayed for employees and managers to see who is online at any given time and to coordinate efforts efficiently. The web application also integrates with a ticketing system that shows the current workload and compares it with the number of employees online. Based on this analysis, it decides whether to send notifications to appropriate team members to come online and assist with the workload.</p><br>
                
                <p>Moreover, Gjallarhorn enhances productivity by providing real-time visibility into employee availability and workload distribution. It offers insights that facilitate better decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately optimizing team performance and ensuring timely resolution of tasks.</p><br>
