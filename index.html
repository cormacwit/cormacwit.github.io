                <h3>Description</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Gjallarhorn is an automated alert system and workload management tool, specifically tailored for use in multinational offices or those adopting a hybrid work-from-home model, especially in continuous operation centers such as those operated by security teams or IT support centers.</p><br>

                <p>Its primary function revolves around a client-side script that diligently monitors endpoint activities, including mouse movements and keyboard interactions. This data is then transmitted to the server, where it is presented in a user-friendly format for employees and managers to track online presence and coordinate tasks effectively.</p><br>
                
                <p>Additionally, the web application seamlessly integrates with a ticketing system to provide real-time insights into the current workload. By comparing the workload with the available online workforce, Gjallarhorn intelligently determines whether it's necessary to notify relevant team members, prompting their online presence to assist in managing the workload efficiently.</p><br>

                <p>The overarching aim of this application is to address the occasional gaps in coverage that may occur due to a dispersed workforce and to facilitate team coordination across multinational offices. By offering a clear overview of available personnel and workload dynamics, Gjallarhorn aims to enhance operational efficiency and promote collaborative efforts in diverse workplace environments.</p>
